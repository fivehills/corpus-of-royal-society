# corpus-of-royal-society
1. The zipped file "textclassification" written in Perl consists of four scripts marked with No.0, 1, 2 and 3. Run them according to the order of numbers, and then twenty subcorpora only containing full-length articles from corpus of royal society will be created. 
2. The remaining three zipped documents are used to calculate relative entropy and linguistic concreteness, and each zipped document is responsible for one of three functions (concreteness, lemma and POS trigram). 
3. Each zipped docuement includes a code script and texts. Due to the large size of all texts in PTRS, just several samples are uploaded here. The code scripts were written by Linux shell and R.
4. After you running scripts, the relevant texts and data will be obtained accordingly.
